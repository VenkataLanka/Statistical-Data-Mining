Effects of Medicinal Marijuana consumption on Opioids Death predictions from statistical data modeling using historical data
A lot of people in the US who suffer from chronic pain tend to use addictive drugs such as Oxycodone & Heroin, which can lead to death due to overdose. Central of Disease Control announces that over 67, 000 death due to opioids abuse last September 2017 (see more details Figure1 below). Recent studies concluded that marijuana appears to put a dent in the opioids abuse epidemic. Here are some numbers about opioids use in the US:
-	2.1M people had opioids use disorder.
-	11.5M misused prescription opioids
-	11.6 people died every day from opioid-related drug overdoses (details ~ Figure 2).
-	Opioid overdose has risen dramatically over the past 15 years and has been implicated in over 500,000 deaths since 2000 -- more than the number of Americans killed in World War II.
For all these reasons, we found this dilemma is interesting and challenging in the same time because this opportunity will give us a chance to strengthen these studies statistically as a “Call to Action” and hopefully be a part of a movement its main goal is to save lives by decreasing opioids deaths rate even though the solution here is marijuana (a lot less risky than opioids).
 Our initial project was about drug poisoning, but we decided to take it to the next level and make it more challenging and interesting at the same time. That’s why we chose for our data analytics project “Marijuana Legalization and Opioid Deaths in the United States.” We invested a lot of time finding valuable data that contain variables needed, but it was hard to find any besides some articles published by Health affairs journal and the University of California “San Deigo” Analytics Department pertaining this subject. These articles advocated that states legalized marijuana for medical use saw a decrease in the opioid epidemic, therefore, deaths rate decreased accordingly. 
Before drawing hypothesis’s, we had one question in mind. Does Legalization of medical marijuana reduce the number of opioid deaths?
